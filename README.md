[![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/mysql/mysql-connector-j?label=Java&color=5382a1)](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/tree/release/8.x/src) [![License: GPLv2 with FOSS exception](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv2_with_FOSS_exception-c30014.svg)](LICENSE) [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.mysql/mysql-connector-j?label=Maven%20Central)](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g%3Acom.mysql+a%3Amysql-connector-j)

MySQL provides connectivity for client applications developed in the Java programming language with MySQL Connector/J, a driver that implements the [Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/) and also [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/).

MySQL Connector/J 8.4 is a JDBC Type 4 driver that is compatible with the [JDBC 4.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jdbc/) specification. The Type 4 designation means that the driver is a pure Java implementation of the MySQL protocol and does not rely on the MySQL client libraries.

The driver also contains an implementation of [MySQL X DevAPI](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/x-devapi-userguide/en/), an application programming interface for working with [MySQL as a Document Store](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/document-store.html) through CRUD-based, NoSQL operations.

For more information, please visit the official [MySQL Connector/J documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/).

## Licensing

Please refer to the [README](README) and [LICENSE](LICENSE) files, available in this repository, and the [Legal Notices in the MySQL Connector/J documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/preface.html) for further details.

## Getting the Latest Release

MySQL Connector/J is free for usage under the terms of the specified licensing and it runs on any operating system that is able to run a Java Virtual Machine.

### Download and Install

MySQL Connector/J can be installed from pre-compiled packages that can be downloaded from the [MySQL Connector/J download page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/). Installing MySQL Connector/J only requires obtaining the corresponding JAR file from the downloaded bundle or installer and including it in the application's CLASSPATH.

According to how you use MySQL Connector/J, you may also need to install the following third-party libraries on your system for it to work:
* Protocol Buffers (protobuf-java) is required for using X DevAPI
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDK for Java (oci-java-sdk) is required to support OCI AIM authentication
* Simple Logging Facade API (slf4j-api) is required for using the logging capabilities provided by the default implementation of org.slf4j.Logger.Slf4JLogger by MySQL Connector/J 

### As a Maven Dependency

Alternatively, MySQL Connector/J can be obtained automatically via [Maven's dependency management](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=g%3Acom.mysql+a%3Amysql-connector-j) by adding the following configuration in the application's Project Object Model (POM) file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>8.4.0</version>
</dependency>
```

MySQL Connector/J's own Project Object Model (POM) file specifies a transitive dependency to Protocol Buffers (protobuf-java) since it is required for using X DevAPI. However, if you do not use the X DevAPI features, you may also want to add a dependency exclusion to avoid linking the unneeded sub-library. For example:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>8.4.0</version>
  <exclusions>
    <exclusion>
      <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
      <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
  </exclusions> 
</dependency>
```

### Build From Source

This driver can also be complied and installed from the source available in this repository. Please refer to the MySQL Connector/J documentation for [detailed instructions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-installing-source.html) on how to do it.
